# Introduction
This `python` script helps user to automate running multiple files in a sequence with some delay in between.
Just place all the files you want to execute along with this script and run this script in one directory and execute this script.

This is extremely helpful in cases where you want to execute thousands of files but running all of them at once can cause some files or system may crash due to RAM shortage.

# Note

## Renaming Instructions: (Optional)
If by any chance you want to rename this file,
you can just change name of the file in the first line of this script.
### For Example: To change name from "File_Autorun_Delay.py" to "main.py"
`ThisFileName = "File_Autorun_Delay.py"` will change to `ThisFileName = "main.py"`

## Running Multiple extension files
Simply run multiple instances of this script for each type of file you want to run.
(1 instance per extension)
